        He invented in 1940 the field sequential trichromatic system (known as STSC), a system for transmitting color television. He also invented later, in the 1960s, a simpler system for generating color, the simplified two-color system. González Camarena launched color television in Mexico years before the implementation of the NTSC standard.

          "González Camarena was a versatile character who found great taste in music and folklore. He was a composer of some beautiful songs. The best known bears the name of “Río colorado”. About this piece it is said that thanks to its success —and the royalties that Camarena received for it— it was possible to finance the creation of the sequential field trichromatic system. He was also an amateur astronomer and a great reader of Mexican history."
        </P>
    	  <cite>-- Thanks to the love and commitment for his people and his country, Camarena rejected all the offers</cite>
